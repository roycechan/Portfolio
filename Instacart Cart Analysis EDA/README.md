# Instacart Cart Analysis EDA with R
## Introduction
In 2017, Instacart provided anonymized data on Kaggle describing customers’ orders over time.

The dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, Instacart provided between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. It also provided the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

**Our objective was to predict which products will be in a user’s next order. EDA was done to discover features that we could use in our modelling process.**
